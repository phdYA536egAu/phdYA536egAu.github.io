<h2>Rules</h2>
<h3><b>Game goals</b></h3>
<p>This is a game for 3 or more players. Each player except one gets a card with a location, which is the same for everyone. One of the players gets a spy card. Nobody knows who is who. </p>

<h3><b>Spy's goal:</b></h3>
<p>To stay undetected, until the time expires, or to guess the location</p>

<h3><b>Other players' goal:</b></h3>
<p>To make the right choice who the spy is.</p>
<p>If one of the players thinks that he/she has detected the spy, participants start voting. If all players who are not spies vote for the right person, the spy comes out. In this case, he/she tries to name the location. If the spy guesses correctly, he/she wins. Otherwise the team wins. If the player is not a spy, the game continues</p>

<h2>How to play</h2>
<p>1. Chose your settings: number of players, number of spies and dictionary</p>
<p>2. Press play</p>
<p>3. Press 'View Card' to view your card</p>
<p>4. Press 'Hide Card' to hide your card and pass the phone/computer to the person beside you</p>
<p>5. Repeat 3 and 4 until all players have seen their card
